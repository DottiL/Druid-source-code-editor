# Druid: source code editor for mobile devices

Today tablets and smart phones are real computers, but their usage is often for fun and entertainment, indeed the App Stores lack of good apps for development. Lots of people spend their free time playing or chatting on their devices, however it can be used for more productive activities, such as writing source code. This app will resolve the problem by providing a good and fast programming environment in combination with programmer-oriented UI, remote file access (Dropbox), customizable syntax highlighting (syntax files) and fast code input (auto-completion and templates).
